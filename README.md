# UI Library Build Impact

This site demonstrates how popular UI libraries influence the size of a Next.js build. Each route renders a component from a library and the **Impact Table** lists the additional JavaScript loaded for that page. Use it to compare libraries and understand the performance cost of adopting them.

This project was originally bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## API

### `/api/component`

Returns build information about UI components. Specify one or more `component` query parameters or a comma‑separated list of names. When `exactMatch` is set to `true` or `1`, results will only include components whose names exactly match any provided value.

```text
/api/component?component=dialog,modal&exactMatch=true
```
